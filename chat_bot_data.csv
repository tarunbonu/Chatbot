"When I print the application in PDF format, parts of the application appear truncated, unclear and / or do not appear at all. Are these parts seen by the Admissions Board ? ",The Admissions Office receives the entire application in appropriate format and all fields are viewed clearly by the Board. The document that the applicant can view is an unformatted version of the final document.
What is the desired length of work experience you wish to see in candidates ?,"The HBS MBA Program is designed for students who have full-time work experience before matriculation. College seniors are encouraged to apply through the 2+2 online application in the expectation that they will be offered ""deferred admission"", i.e. an offer of admission to a future class conditional upon acquiring full-time work experience, as a positive outcome. It is important for candidates to assess their own readiness when deciding to apply: there is no universal ""right"" time."
What constitutes work experience ?,Work experience includes opportunities in which students have been able to develop their professional and leadership skills. 
Are there specific types of work experience that will make me a more attractive candidate ?,"Rather than focus on specific categories of work experiences, applicants should focus on their roles, responsibilities, and what they have learned from the types of work experiences that they have been involved in. The Admissions Board will look at the nature of the applicant's work experience when evaluating the applicants' ability to handle the academic rigor of our MBA program."
Who should recommendations come from ? ,"The Admissions Board suggests that one recommendation should come from a current or recent supervisor, if possible. Recommenders should be individuals who know the candidate well and who can attest to the candidate's leadership ability."
What is the process for recommenders ?,Candidates enter recommenders' names and email addresses into their online application. Recommenders then receive an email with a link to their recommendation. The recommendations are submitted separately from the candidates' application and will automatically be included in the application upon submission. Applicants should not wait for recommenders to submit their recommendations before submitting their applications.
Is the recommendation deadline the same as the application deadline ? ,Applicants should submit their applications as soon as they feel ready. Recommendations are submitted separately by the recommenders. Please bear in mind that it is the applicant's responsibility to ensure that all recommendations are submitted online by the deadline date for the round in which the applicant is applying.

The timing of your interview does not imply anything about the status of your application nor does it impact your candidacy.

Will HBS provide feedback for applicants who have been rejected ?,"Due to the large number of applications we receive each year, we cannot accommodate requests for personalized feedback on your application.  We receive over 8,000 applications for approximately 900 places in the class, and therefore have to deny admission to many exceptional individuals.  Also, please understand that the decision of the Admissions Board is final, and we cannot advise you on whether or not you should reapply in the future.  "

"My undergraduate concentration is in a business-related field, and I have had a lot of business exposure. Is 2+2 the right program for me ?","When the 2+2 Program was originally created it primarily targeted students who were not already on a business track (i.e. students studying the liberal arts, sciences, engineering, etc.). However, we are now encouraging students from all undergraduate majors to apply; that includes those with concentrations and experiences in business-related fields."
"Can I apply to the 2+2 Program if I am interested in pursuing a joint degree (MBA / MPP or MPA-ID, MBA / JD, MBA / MD, MBA / DMD, etc.) ?","Applicants to the 2+2 Program who are considering a joint degree should contact our partner schools (Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard Law School, Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Dental Medicine) for more information about the degrees offered. To be eligible for a joint degree program, you must be admitted separately to both Harvard schools. We cannot counsel applicants about the suitability of a particular joint degree program or how it may impact your future career goals. If you are admitted to the 2+2 Program and wish to pursue a joint degree program, we will work with you to determine how your plans can meet the 2+2 work experience expectations. More details will be offered after you are admitted. For more information about the joint degree programs offered by HBS, go to the Joint Degree Programs section on the HBS website. "
How many letters of recommendation are required ?,We require two letters of recommendation as part of the 2+2 Program application process.
Who should my recommendations come from ?,"Recommenders should be individuals who know you well and who can relate specific and relevant details about your abilities and performance.

The Admissions Board discourages recommendations from peers."

Is there a list of approved or recommended companies to work for during the required pre-MBA work experience ?,"No. Admitted 2+2 students have the flexibility to explore career options in a multitude of industries including traditional companies to start-ups as long as their positions help develop their professional and leadership skills. Historically, the variety of full-time positions admitted 2+2 students pursue have been similar to the diversity of industries and function areas that are represented in the MBA program."
"My bachelor's degree program did not follow a traditional four year timeline (i.e. it was shorter or longer), am I still eligible to apply to HBS through the 2+2 process ?",Yes. You can apply to HBS through the 2+2 program as long as you are in your final year of undergraduate study. There are no minimum or maximum requirements for the length of time spent working toward your bachelor's degree.
